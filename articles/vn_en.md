title: Totally Biased Visual Novel Reviews (Ongoing Updates, Translated by Gemini)
---

## Introduction
- This document is meant to record my thoughts on visual novels I've played recently. I'll write as things come to mind, so it might seem a bit disorganized.
- The games on this list are visual novels in a broad sense, including Galgames, text ADVs, and other text-based games.
- This is purely subjective scoring. I'll only write about what I personally found to be exceptionally good/bad about a game.
- Despite being purely subjective, I'll explain my basic principles when scoring:
    - When scoring, I try to focus on the game's greatest "strengths," because I believe people play games to experience things they can't find in other works.
    - However, if a weakness is so severe that it significantly impacts the gameplay experience, I will point it out and deduct points.
    - Furthermore, some works I might say have no particular flaws, but this doesn't mean they're perfect. The difficulty of telling a simple story well is completely different from telling a complex story well.
- Works with an asterisk (*) left a deep impression on me in some aspect (in a positive way). This is unrelated to the score.
