title: Visual Novels (Ongoing Updates, translated by ChatGPT)  
---

## Introduction
- I’m writing this to jot down my thoughts on the visual novels I’ve recently played. It’s freeform and spontaneous, so it might feel a bit disorganized.
- The games listed here are broadly categorized as visual novels, including galgames, text-based adventure games, and similar narrative-heavy titles.
- Ratings are entirely subjective. I’ll mostly comment on what I think the game did exceptionally well or terribly poorly.
- Even though it's all personal opinion, here are the rough principles I use when rating:
    - I try to focus on a game’s strongest qualities—because we play games to experience things we can’t get elsewhere.
    - But if the flaws are bad enough to kill the enjoyment, I’ll point them out and dock points accordingly.
    - Also, just because I say a game has no major flaws doesn’t mean it’s a 10/10. Telling a simple story well is not the same as telling a complex one well.
- A rating with * means the game left a particularly strong (positive) impression in some way. It's independent of the score.

## Main Reviews

### White Album 2
- **My Take**: Tightly structured story, incredibly detailed portrayal of the characters’ inner thoughts. One of the genre’s all-time greats.
- **Pros**: Nothing short of legendary. It’s the gold standard for anime romance narratives—unmatched before or after. The dialogue and psychological writing are stellar. One of the few galgames where the slice-of-life parts aren't boring.
- **Cons**:
    - Some plot developments rely a bit too much on convenient coincidences to move things along (like Miho catching Haruki and Koharu together). At times it leans into that soap-opera melodrama.
    - Chiaki’s route is gripping, but her behavior might come off as nonsensical. Like… who the hell fakes a relationship just to write a play?
- **Rating**: 10*/10

### Ace Attorney 1–3
- **My Take**: The OG of its kind—and still one of the best. Every aspect, from music and art to pacing and writing, is super polished. The text is sharp and snappy—especially evident when examining or presenting evidence.
- **Pros**: A classic for good reason.
- **Cons**:
    - Some cases get way too far-fetched, like the circus cape thing or swinging across a burning bridge with a rope in 3-5.
- **Rating**: 10*/10

### Full Metal Daemon Muramasa
- **My Take**: Just like its title character, this game is twisted and intense. Nearly flawless in terms of production—music, art, and direction are all top-tier. The writer knows exactly how to build tension and mess with your head.
- **Pros**:
    - Despite being text-heavy, the action scenes, psychological tension, and world-building are excellent.
    - The art direction is also impressive, especially the combat sequences.
    - The amount of detail poured into creating this world is mind-blowing.
- **Cons**:
    - The Hero arc’s black-and-white morality might feel a bit heavy-handed—but that’s also part of its charm. Every character represents an ideology rather than a fully fleshed-out human, which leads to behavior that feels rigid or extreme.
- **Rating**: 9*/10

### Steins;Gate
- **My Take**:
- **Pros**:
    - For a mystery title, it packs a surprisingly emotional punch. It wrings every drop out of a simple sci-fi premise to tell a gripping story.
- **Cons**:
    - The early game is slow-paced, though it does plant a lot of foreshadowing. Still, there’s filler that could’ve been trimmed.
    - Some routes feel forced. Like in Ruka’s route—after wrestling with gender identity and Mayuri’s fate, the protagonist just… chooses to save Ruka over Mayuri? I get that they wanted endings for all love interests like a typical galgame, but the emotional pivot was too rushed. Needed more buildup to make it land.
- **Rating**: 9*/10

### 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim
- **My Take**: Uses multi-threaded storytelling like *428: Shibuya Scramble*, but differs greatly in other ways: TBA.
- **Pros**:
    - Fantastic nonlinear narrative.
    - Cleverly fuses classic sci-fi tropes into something fresh.
    - Tons of subtle foreshadowing. Dialogue is tight and purposeful.
- **Cons**:
    - You have to play RTS battles to unlock more story. The RTS parts aren't bad per se—but they completely throw off the pacing.
- **Rating**: 9*/10

### YOU and ME and HER: A Love Story
- **My Take**: Short but punchy. Inspired many later meta-heavy visual novels.
- **Pros**:
    - The twists in the second and third playthroughs are wild and emotionally well-executed.
- **Cons**:
    - The reveal that Aoi is basically a “galgame heroine composite” is a bit of a deus ex machina. A concept that specific needed more setup or explanation. Broad concepts like magic or mechas are easier to accept without much justification—but something this particular needs groundwork.
- **Rating**: 8*/10

### Witch on the Holy Night
- **My Take**: A no-choice visual novel, much shorter than your typical galgame, but well-paced with no real dull moments.
- **Pros**:
    - Gorgeous art—layered CGs packed with detail. Things like cloud movement or light gradually filling a room are done to perfection. Easily one of the best-looking text games I’ve seen.
    - Excellent sound design. Ambient effects are context-sensitive. One moment stood out where the text was like, “the MC was so shocked that he felt like the rain suddenly stopped(actually it didn't stop)” and the background rain actually *does* stop. That kind of polish is rare.
- **Cons**:
    - The worldbuilding is shaky—new rules just pop up out of nowhere, making some scenes feel like plot devices. It's not a mystery story, so not a major issue, but still.
    - I’m not a fan of the writing style. Sometimes the author takes a simple point and tries to make it sound profound with needlessly cryptic language. Other times it veers into artsy nonsense. Overall, the prose feels pretentious.
    - Strip away the flashy language and you get a super basic story. The characters are cookie-cutter archetypes and their inner lives are barely developed.
- **Rating**: 8/10

### Rewrite+
- **My Take**: Big ambitions, not enough skill to back it up. Tries to cover a lot thematically, but only the family stuff hits home. Bloated with filler and poor pacing.
- **Pros**:
    - Lots of content—multiple long personal routes.
    - Worldbuilding has a lot of potential.
    - Some scenes are super romantic, like the protagonist turning into a tree.
- **Cons**:
    - The common route is painfully long—and more boring than *Ever17*.
    - The romance is thin. Most girls fall for the protagonist without any real foundation.
    - Plot is messy. Tons of important details are left up to the player to guess. Moon and Terra routes were supposed to clarify things… but just added more confusion. How did the monsters end up on the moon again?
    - Some plot points feel contrived. Like the literal embodiment of Earth’s will being a cute girl who falls in love with the protagonist. That’s divine messiah-tier levels of convenient.
    - Way too idealistic, weak plot logic. Like how in the Terra route, the protagonist singlehandedly takes down two world-dominating organizations. Really?
- **Rating**: 7.5*/10

### Senren Banka
- **My Take**: Standard anime romance formula. No major strengths or weaknesses compared to similar games.
- **Rating**: 7.5/10

### WHITE ALBUM: Memories like Falling Snow

- **My Take**:
- **Pros**:
- **Cons**:
- **Rating**: 7/10

### Air
- **My Take**: I really love the vibe of this game. It also gave us classics like “Tori no Uta” and “Natsukage.” Sadly, like many Key games, the writing has issues.
- **Pros**:
    - Music and art perfectly capture that nostalgic summer feeling. To this day, I think of *Air* when summer rolls around.
    - The Summer arc jumps back a thousand years in time—refreshing change of pace, and it supports the game’s core theme of “inheritance.”
    - The Air arc revisits the Dream arc from a new perspective, tying up some loose ends. I’m a sucker for symmetrical structure like that.
- **Cons**:
    - The Dream arc’s slice-of-life content is boring, like most galgames.
    - Relationship development between the protagonist and heroines feels unearned—especially in Minagi's route.
    - The Air arc’s first half is long-winded. It replays a lot of Dream’s content with barely any changes. Only worth repeating if you’re adding a new layer of meaning.
    - Overuse of dramatic monologues. During emotional climaxes, characters just pour their hearts out nonstop. The lines get repetitive, and it gets tiring fast. More restraint, and some third-person narration, would’ve made the scenes hit harder.
- **Rating**: 7*/10

### Ever17
- **My Take**: Like making a giant dumpling just to hide one really clever twist in the middle. Most of it is just dough.
- **Pros**:
    - The twist was mind-blowing—especially for its time.
- **Cons**:
    - Repetitive common route. You need multiple playthroughs to reach the real payoff: Coco’s route.
    - Flat characters.
    - Worldbuilding isn’t convincing. A huge underwater facility has an emergency and no one intervenes?
    - Some scenes just defy logic. The cast gets trapped underwater but act like they’re on a school trip.
    - Tons of unresolved plot points (like life indicators, the can-kicking thing). Even fan explanations contradict each other because the game never gives you enough info to reach consensus.
- **Rating**: 6*/10

### ATRI -My Dear Moments-
- **My Take**: Simple story about a robot slowly learning emotions. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing offensive.
- **Rating**: 6/10

### Muv-Luv Alternative
- **My Take**: Feels bloated. Huge worldbuilding, but the actual plot feels small-scale.
- **Pros**:
    - Interesting setting. The ending’s explanation of Sumika’s powers and the protagonist’s origin is a highlight.
- **Cons**:
    - The protagonist is unlikable—and barely grows. His only real “growth” is no longer PTSD-ing at the sight of BETA. You can’t claim you want to save the world but freeze up when lives are on the line. Either step up or step back.
    - Battle scenes are so poorly animated it kills immersion. Looks like someone just discovered Photoshop’s move/rotate tool.
    - Tons of long, pointless dialogue that doesn’t build character or story. Same point repeated multiple times.
    - The plot keeps shrinking in scope. Early on, political moves made sense. But by the end, Operation Cherry Blossom feels like a dumb shonen gamble—let’s bet humanity on one guy!
    - The romance clashes hard with the setting. I get that men are rare, but turning the military into a dating sim is just… huh? Plus, the flirty banter during training/combat is painful to watch.
    - Same structure on repeat. Fight -> someone dies -> rest talk about why they fight. If the combat was well-executed and the post-fight talks weren't so circular, maybe it’d work. But they aren’t, so it gets stale fast.
- **Rating**: 6/10
